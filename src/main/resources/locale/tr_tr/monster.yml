    A mob (short for 'Monster Or Beast') is a generic term for any non-player
    entity whose primary purpose is to be killed for experience, quest
    objective, or loot. They tend to be aggressive to all players.

    When a monster dies, the killer is determined by most damage dealt instead
    of the last hit. If you're at a party, your damages add up. Killers gain
    experience, quest objective, and 30 seconds of protection on item drops if
    any.
  h2: Skills

    Monsters can cast skills just like players. Basic monsters usually have only
    1 skill or no skill at all, while boss monsters have more than 5 skills.
  h3: Boss Monster
  p3: >-
    Boss type monsters are the hardest to kill. A common characteristic for all
    bosses is that they have a unique name and appear once at a time. Dungeons
    usually have a boss in the last room that you must defeat to complete the
    dungeon.
