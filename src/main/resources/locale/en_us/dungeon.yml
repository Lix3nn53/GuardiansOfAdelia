guide:
  p0: >-
    Dungeons are 4 players instances that will take players to the darkest
    corners of Adelia. They always contain one or more bosses, large amounts of
    enemies and loot.
  h1: Portals
  p1: >-
    Each dungeon has a portal which you can interract with LEFT click. Dungeon
    join gui will open on interract.
  h2: Join Gui
  p2: >-
    Each dungeon has 4 instances which you can join if it hasn't started yet.
    You can see info about dungeon like required level, time limit and
    weaknesses & resistances of boss. A countdown will start when first player
    joins a dungeon instance, 3 more players can join during the countdown.
    Dungeon starts when the countdown finishes if there is at least one player.
  h3: Scoreboard
  p3: >-
    A scoreboard will show up on dungeon start. You can see boss name, remaining
    time in seconds, darkness, rooms left and remaining healths of party
    members.
  h4: Darkness
  p4: >-
    While you stay in the dungeon, the darkness overwhelms you. As darkness
    rises you deal less damage, take more damage, and the monsters get stronger.
    So it is better to reach the boss room as soon as possible.
  h5: Rooms
  p5: >-
    A dungeon room has spawners and waves. When you kill all the monsters in a
    wave, the next wave starts. When you complete all the waves in a room, the
    room is complete and the doors open.
  h6: Prizes
  p6: >-
    When you kill the boss the dungeon is completed and 4 prize chests will
    spawn. You need keys to get prize chests. First key is earned with defating
    the boss, second key is earned if darkness is less than 70%, third key is
    earned if all rooms are completed. When you LEFT click a chest you will get
    it if you have a key. If you RIGHT click while holding the chest, you will
    gain a random item. There are 6 types of prize chests: melee & ranged
    weapons, heavy & light armor, jewelry and pet.
